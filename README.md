## About this project

This is just a thought and I am not planning to work it out recently.

As a international students I will be in constant moving to different places, but everytime it is a pain to try to empty a place. The biggest problem is all those small furnitures I have in the home. I have a rice cooker, a water boiler, 2 pots, 3 bowls, etc. in the kitchen, I have added furnitures to my room like temporary wardrobe and drawer cart. The real problem for them is they are not small, not in organizable shape, not - in common sense - should be put with clothes inside a suitcase, and sometimes delicate. Generally these are not stuff people travel with, but because of the nature of studying abroad/away from home, students do have them in the dorm/rented house. Normally house owner would say "get rid of everything you added to the room", so these things becomes a headache.

One way to get rid of them was to ask a friend who has extra room to help me store these stuff until I am back, but it feels bad to ask for such favor. Another solution was to pay someone to store it for you, but paying is not ideal. Third solution is to take them with you, but while I could possibly take bowls and pots, others - like wardrobe - are not gonna work. Last solution is to throw them away, which is a huge waste and also a headache for dorm manager to handle.

Actually, these are something new renters might be able to utilize. For example, bowls and pots. If I ended up throwing them away, it is likely new renters will just buy a new set for themselves. So, it is possible to find somewhere to share these resources.

There are a lot of other considerations needed to actually make this sound like an idea, but currently the above is what I have
